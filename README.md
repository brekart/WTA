# WTA - War Thunder Assistant

A program that aims to ease the difficulty of certain aspects of War Thunder. Currently, this is planned to be an auto-trim feature for use in simulator battles. Because there's no immediately available aircraft trim charts that I can find, this trim data will have to be entered manually. As such, it will be necessary to work on one plane's auto-trim at a time. The first plane will likely be the Bf-110-G2 due to my existing familiarity and fondness of the plane. 

# Initial steps-
1. Isolate localhost data provided by War Thunder during gameplay using http://127.0.0.1:8111/
  Either:
    a. Determine a suitable algorithm to produce level flight in the given aircraft, or
    b. Hard-code trim settings for the given aircraft based on speed/altitude/etc
    
# Future goals-
  1. Weapons testing/penetration simulator
  2. Aircraft/tank camo viewer
  3. User-funded repository of joystick/controller mappings for easy access
  4. GE/RP/etc calculators (How much will I pay to pay to buy my way to x?)
